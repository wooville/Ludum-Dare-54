  - ... Next!
  - Where's your soul?
  - You can't get in here without a soul.
  - Why do they always cry...
  - "Look, kid. I\u2019ll help you out. This is the realm of lost souls. You can't
    get out without finding yours first."
  - Those disconnected from themselves get trapped here for eternity.
  - Unless you want to end up like that, come back after you've found your soul.
  - Just be quick about it. This place is running out of space as it is.
